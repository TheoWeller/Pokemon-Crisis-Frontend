# Pokemon-Crisis-Frontend

Pokemon Kry51s is a pair programming project Jack Hilscher (https://github.com/Guillamoure) worked on at The Flatiron School.

Over the course of five days we had a blast fetching from the Pokemon api (https://pokeapi.co/) and reshaping their massive amounts of Pokemon data into digestable chunks that we could utilize to create a simple 1v1 battle style game play.
